title: Embedding Gists in Jekyll Posts
tags: [jekyll gist]

Having had middling success including code in posts here I wondered whether it was possible to embed [gists](https://gist.github.com) instead of relying on markdown and css.

It is and it's very straightforward indeed.

So the following embedded gist demonstrates the code required to embed a gist

{% gist 92b3fce859806a435a96 %}

{% gist 92b3fce859806a435a96 file-embed %}

Which can also be seen in this post's [source](https://github.com/idiotandrobot/blog/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2015-04-27-Embedding-Gists-In-Jekyll-Posts.md)
