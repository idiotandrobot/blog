[Code](http://charlespetzold.com/code/index.html) by [Charles Petzold](http://charlespetzold.com/) is an excellent read, "a unique exploration into bits, bytes, and the inner workings of computers".
I thought it would be interesting to write an application to generate the combination of Braille, Morse and Binary found on the cover for any text input. 
I assumed someone would have done this already as the book is now a good 15 years old. 
If they have I couldn't find it.
