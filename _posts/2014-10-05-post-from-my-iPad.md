Bit of a cheat as I've just done the phone post and so therefore can just about remember all the criteria for a value post. Maybe try again later and see how that goes.

Apart from having to drill down into the blog project _posts folder on github to create a new entry. Not terrible.

But then these aren't exactly complicated posts.
