GitHub, not unreasonably, has a read-only mobile site. Writing this on the desktop site on my phone is fairly awful. Even ignoring my terrible memory wrt the header values.

**Update**:
Also, and not for the first time, I forgot the .md file extension. So it didn't post and I'm now editing this on my iPad.

**Update Update**:
And the front matter header properties are case sensitive, which is great news given mobile's tendency to capitalise.
