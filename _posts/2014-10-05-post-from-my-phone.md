Title: Post from my phone
---
GitHub, not unreasonably, has a read-only mobile site. Writing this on the desktop site on my phone is fairly awful. Even ignoring my terrible memory wrt the header values.

**Update**
Also, and not for the first time, I forgot the .md file extension. So it didn't post and I'm now editing this on my iPad.
