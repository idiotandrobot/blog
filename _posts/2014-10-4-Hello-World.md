title: Setting up a blog using Jekyll on GitHub
---

There are various ways of doing this. This one has been done by forking the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. 

[This article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) by the author of Jekyll now is a pretty good guide.

As it was set up as a [Project Page rather than a User Page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) it has all the fun of needing a gh-pages branch.
