The solution suggested on various forums is to run 'sfc /scannow' from an [Administrator Command Prompt](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/run-a-command-as-administrator-from-the-windows-vista-run-box/) and then restart Outlook.

In my case emails were sitting in the Outbox and the 'Outlook Send/Receive progress' dialog wasn't showing any errors.

I also had to open the email in question from the Outbox and hit 'Send' again.
