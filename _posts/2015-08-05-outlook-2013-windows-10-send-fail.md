title: Outlook 2013 not sending emails since Windows 10 upgrade

In my case emails were sitting in the Outbox and the 'Outlook Send/Receive progress' dialog wasn't showing any errors.

The solution suggested on various forums is to run 'sfc /scannow' from an Administrator Command Prompt and then restart Outlook.

I also had to open the email in question from the Outbox and hit 'Send' again.
